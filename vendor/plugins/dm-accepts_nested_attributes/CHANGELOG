 * Use jeweler, add standard dm-more tasks and bump to 0.12.0

[2a08a89 | Mon Nov 23 16:46:40 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * Simplified require statements

[e24cefe | Mon Nov 23 16:53:50 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * Use :required => true instead of :nullable => false

    This means that dm-accepts_nested_attributes now
    depends on dm-core >= 0.10.2

[4c30792 | Mon Sep 21 17:06:53 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * Fixed error message in case no appropriate relationship was found

[41f43e8 | Thu Sep 17 12:19:11 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * Simplified code doesn't depend on class_inheritable_reader

    This means that dana is now usable inside modules,
    which is necessary for proper dm-is-remixable suppport
    and my dm-is-localizable plugin in particular.

[95041df | Sat Sep 12 20:02:37 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * Removed current limitations section from README

    This no longer applies.

[780f8a0 | Sat Sep 12 14:15:05 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * Refactored to support ruby 1.9

    This should fix the following error that was
    previously thrown on ruby 1.9.1
    
      implicit argument passing of super from method
      defined by define_method is not supported
    
    Also, it really should have been this way from
    the beginning. Using define_method was completely
    unnecessary.

[95ab6bf | Thu Sep 03 15:42:08 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * Finally, all specs pass!

    * I'm not really pleased with the way it works now
      though. If anyone has better suggestions, I'd be
      glad to hear them.

[503e6d9 | Wed Sep 02 13:00:56 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * Removed now unnecessary workaround

[f47516a | Fri Aug 28 15:22:56 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * Destroying m:n now works, 1:1 and 1:n don't :)

    * Getting weird can't modify frozen object errors
      in has_1_spec and has_n_spec when running specs
      for destroy.

[07122e4 | Fri Aug 28 15:20:24 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * Allow dm-constraints to migrate the constraints

[e0d017a | Wed Aug 05 17:21:45 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * Strip whitespace

[19d1871 | Wed Aug 05 17:13:16 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * Support STI scenarios

    * Previously, calling accepts_nested_attributes_for
      on an STI subclass resulted in errors because
      options_for_nested_attributes wasn't inherited.
    
    * Hopefully this commit fixes that. No specs to prove
      that though, so far.

[d36e7ee | Wed Aug 05 17:11:15 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * Enable 'rake spec' without errors saying dm-core can't be found

    * However, rake spec still yields weird transaction errors like
    
      Lock wait timeout exceeded; try restarting transaction

[1d51f5b | Tue Aug 04 13:08:41 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * Bumped version

[2fa2de4 | Mon Aug 03 07:53:51 UTC 2009] Angel N. Sciortino <contact@angeliccomputing.com>

 * update operations now perform validations too

    * This is achieved by calling resource.attributes = ...
      followed by resource.save under the hood.
    
    * Once Resource#update calls Resource#save inside dm-core
      this shouldn't be necessary anymore (but wouldn't hurt
      either)

[286ac11 | Mon Aug 03 18:19:02 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * Commented currently unspecced relationship declarations

    * These introduce lots of spec failures because dm-core
      seems to establish not nullable FK properties on the
      target end of the relationship.
    
    * For reference, the specs started failing with
      http://is.gd/20SH8

[571ba2e | Fri Jul 31 16:20:25 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * Removed obsolete section from README

[9a9bbe1 | Fri Jul 03 14:26:21 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * spec fixtures for has_1_through and has_n_through with n intermediaries

[ae1acfa | Fri Jul 03 13:55:32 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * added additional spec expectations for nested attribute writers

    * Added explicit expectations to prove that calling
      nested attribute writers never alters the state
      of the storage engine directly. Persistence will
      only happen when #save is called.

[7b0194f | Wed Jul 01 19:41:38 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * support composite keys when creating new nested resources

    * refactored the previous constant into it's own method
      to support composite keys and also allow overwriting

[a9efa26 | Wed Jul 01 18:45:49 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * no assumptions on the length of the m:m target collection

    * Maybe this will never be necessary, but I'm still thinking
      about how this whole #assign_or_mark_for_destruction method
      could be refactored. I don't like the fact the name itself
      already implies that this method has 2 different purposes.

[d2e0a9d | Wed Jul 01 18:20:36 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * fixed renaming regression in #normalize_attributes_collection

[34efa0f | Wed Jul 01 18:19:57 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * don't sort attributes in #normalize_attributes_collection

    * I can see no real advantage in doing so, let's keep it simple

[5a17003 | Wed Jul 01 18:18:11 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * idiomatic datamapper usage

    * this changes the spec error to a simple unmet expectation
      compared to an fk violation error before
    
    * this is kind of weird, since existing_record is the same
      in both cases

[fa4edde | Wed Jul 01 16:46:47 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * no need to do anything if the m:m target collection is empty

[599da7f | Wed Jul 01 16:45:20 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * don't expect the target_collection to always be of length 1

    * actually this is the case in the current implementation,
      but that may change, and the code is simpler that way

[2ce2b3f | Wed Jul 01 16:40:22 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * respect composite keys at the target end of m:m relationships

[0331a9f | Wed Jul 01 16:05:04 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * mark the correct resources for destruction in m:m scenario

    * However, it doesn't work, because the target resource always
      gets destroyed before the intermediaries

[a1e8da4 | Mon Jun 29 15:39:19 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * removed meaningless documentation

[a07dcef | Thu Jun 25 03:26:08 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * added spec that proves that m2m deletion wipes out all intermediaries

    * this is bad bad behavior and needs to be fixed

[c8d21a0 | Thu Jun 25 03:04:20 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * all specs pass with or without dm-constraints

    * deleted an invalid spec that expected dm-constraints
      to be present

[6913c23 | Thu Jun 25 02:42:13 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * allow github to build a datamapper 0.10 compatible gem

[d6abeb1 | Thu Jun 25 02:39:03 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * removed rspec tmbundle logger support

[bc119f9 | Thu Jun 25 02:34:45 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * support running specs with or without dm-constraints

[84609fb | Thu Jun 25 01:57:03 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * updated datamapper 0.10.0 compatibility information

[bda6fbc | Thu Jun 25 01:53:38 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * cleaner code for many_to_many deletion

    * also added TODO note about handling this with
      mark_for_destruction like all the other
      relationship kinds.

[bce5322 | Thu Jun 25 00:58:11 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * support deleting of many_to_many associations (all specs pass)

    * Deletion is currently triggered when calling the nested
      attribute writer. This is most probably not desired and
      is likely to change.
    
    * Example:
    
      Person.has(n, :projects, :through => :project_memberships)
      @person.projects_attributes = {
        :id => project.id, :_delete => true
      }
    
      This will delete the associated project_membership
      and then the project

[a8f2a9a | Wed Jun 24 15:52:48 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * mark_for_destruction? now really returns true or false (not nil)

[8127032 | Wed Jun 24 15:44:27 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * corrected specs for atomic commits

    * those specs aren't really shared, but only valid
      for situations with no :reject_if guard that returns
      true.
    
    * only 1 spec failing now and that's deleting
      has(n, :through)

[226a5a6 | Wed Jun 24 04:00:41 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * added hopefully last missing documentation

[51b5fdb | Wed Jun 24 03:54:41 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * finished documenting all modules and methods

    * also fixed a bug where attributes weren't sent
      to the :reject_if guard in case the guard was
      specified as Symbol or String.

[faeaf5b | Wed Jun 24 02:05:08 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * #save_self no overwritten on every resource

    * this makes more deletion specs pass and is actually
      really obvious. wonder why it took me so long.
    
    * still a few atomic commits related specs failing
      but slowly getting there.
    
    * also, this needs my current dm-validations work
      available at
      http://github.com/snusnu/dm-more/commits/validation_context_work

    * i don't like the name, it already indicates that

[0ae2f1a | Mon Jun 15 15:02:02 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * less invasive dm-core overwrite in Resource#save_parents

 * made all but 3 specs pass

    * this means that all specs except those that test
      destroying of an associated resource via the
      nested attribute accessors, works.
    
    * TODO this spec change needs more thinking. I'm
      not yet sure if not creating a Person in this case
      is the right behavior.

 * made normalize_attributes_collection self contained

[b42cf92 | Wed May 27 21:50:16 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * removed specs for ':reject_if => :foo' for now

    * added a TODO note to remind me to add them back again,
      once i have decided where to best put them.

[57ccf94 | Wed May 27 21:41:59 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * check proper exception class in specs

[6fa76ee | Wed May 27 21:11:54 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * replaced meaningless specs with one that makes sense

[361a5d1 | Wed May 27 21:01:04 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

[5e22497 | Wed May 27 20:51:04 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * replaced explicitly defined helper with dm-core api access

[e981ce6 | Wed May 27 19:10:46 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * cleaned up weird condition syntax

[9a6318c | Wed May 27 19:10:20 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * better usage of RelationshipAccess

    * it's not necessary to call relationship! from
      inside accepts_nested_attributes_for.
      The association_name is *definitely* valid at
      this time.

[6e8c49f | Wed May 27 18:20:47 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * model extension now less invasive and easier to extend

    * Added relationship/relationship! methods to
      provide a cleaner interface to the relationships
      defined on a model. This hides the implementation
      detail that relationships are stored in a hash
      which is bound to change anyway. Also, it allows
      to *fail fast* when trying to access a relationship
      that is not defined in a model (via relationship!)
    
    * restructured the files to better encapsulate and
      communicate what's in them.
    
    * better use of dm-core methods allowed previously
      explicitly declared methods to be removed.

 * respect dm-is-remixable (thx Asher Van Brunt for pointing this out)

    Since class_inheritable_accessor is not available on Module, dana
    bailed out for dm-is-remixable. This should hopefully fix this issue.

[ef8e1ca | Mon May 11 00:17:43 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * added CHANGELOG rake task and file (taken from manveru/ramaze)

 * less brittle specs with no more auto_migrations before(:each)

[f2a2fcb | Wed Apr 29 01:38:00 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * updated Manifest and gemspec to reflect spec cleanings

[dd0a4a8 | Fri Apr 24 17:29:41 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * removed fixtures and specs for customized has(n, :through) associations.

    It makes no sense to spec all different options for the association
    macros in integration specs. Rather, it should be specced once and
    for all (in unit specs) that dm-accepts_nested_attributes infers the
    right kind of associations. Think about it, then do it!

[ac7c008 | Fri Apr 24 17:27:12 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * be explicit about before(:each)

[7a56d17 | Fri Apr 24 17:26:35 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * no need to require gem dependencies in spec_helper.rb

[2118726 | Wed Apr 15 18:57:22 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * initial support for wrapping every save inside a transaction.

    * this probably needs more thinking, also funny is that specs if
      called from textmate rspec bundle all pass, whereas when called
      from the shell, some of them (only has(1)) break.
      investigate this
    * dbussink also suggested it might be a good idea to add an option
      that allows to turn transaction usage off.
    * also, look for some api to infer wether a backend supports
      (nested) transactions or not. we could default to true if it does,
      but still leave the option to turn it off nevertheless.

[abdc211 | Wed Apr 15 14:18:07 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * added sanitize_nested_attributes to provide a hook for doing this.

[32dcfe8 | Wed Apr 15 02:20:00 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * initial support for dm-validations

    * this desperately needs specs! currently only basic not null
      constraint specs pass (well, there are no other).
    * saving a resource along with its associations should always
      be done inside a transaction! figure out how to do that!
    * validation errors from associated resources should be copied
      to the parent resource. this currently happens, but it's not
      specced at all so consider the behavior undefined.

[fef1578 | Wed Apr 15 01:37:14 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * initialize dm logger before setting up dm adapter

[8d7ede8 | Wed Apr 15 01:35:50 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

[b45ea52 | Fri Apr 10 16:12:11 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * added get_#{association_name} helper for (many/one)_to_one associations.

    This is mainly to support common usecases in fields_for. This method
    will return a new record if the associated object is nil at the time
    it is accessed, and the associated object otherwise. This should help
    fields_for to render the right id and name attributes for the input
    fields. This method is not generated for (one/many)_to_many associations
    since these return an Collection anyway and this allow to call build
    or get on it. A possible use case would look something like this:
    
    <% fields_for @location.get_geo_point do %>
     ...
    <% end =%>
    
    The whole purpose of this commit is to provide something to fields_for
    that is guaranteed to not be nil.
